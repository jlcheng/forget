* DONE Research "bleve zip" and "bleve scorch" commands

    Though I'm not sure if I totally care. I have many things to read and I don't see the purpose of fully understanding
    this if I don't have further troubles with scorch.
* DONE Design: How to batch index documents?
After watching the talk 
Rethinking Classical Concurrency Patterns video from Bryan C. Mills
I've concluded that I would avoid an async API at the 'library' level. In other words, deferring dealing with blocking
to the UI.
* TODO Have a plan for describing, indexing, and recalling words with multiple meanings
  - Note taken on [2018-10-14 Sun 07:42] \\
    As an example, the word 'terminal' has different meanings based on its context.
    If the context is "shell scripting", then terminal means that thing you're
    typing into. 
    
    If the context is "Backusâ€“Naur Form" then 'terminal' means "tokens",
    "smallest block in our BNF grammar".

    It is clear in this case, we don't want to treat terms and defintions simply as
    terminal (title) => thing you're typing into (body)
    We'll need some other attribute to describe the idea of context; Or perhaps deduce
    context from the body.
