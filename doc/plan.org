* TODO Research "bleve zip" and "bleve scorch" commands

    Though I'm not sure if I totally care. I have many things to read and I don't see the purpose of fully understanding
    this if I don't have further troubles with scorch.

* TODO Design: How to batch index documents?
  arrivals      // notifies us of a new doc to be indexed
  finish        // notifies us that the system is shutting down
  timer         // notifies that it is time to to commit any batched docs

  begin         // callback: beginning of a batch
  commit        // callback: end of a batch
  		//  What should be the signature of these functions? They need to modify the 'buffer' variable that
		//  arrival and finish code refer to and do it in a safe way.
		
  buffer        // new arrivals are stored here
* TODO Have a plan for describing, indexing, and recalling words with multiple meanings
  - Note taken on [2018-10-14 Sun 07:42] \\
    As an example, the word 'terminal' has different meanings based on its context.
    If the context is "shell scripting", then terminal means that thing you're
    typing into. 
    
    If the context is "Backusâ€“Naur Form" then 'terminal' means "tokens",
    "smallest block in our BNF grammar".

    It is clear in this case, we don't want to treat terms and defintions simply as
    terminal (title) => thing you're typing into (body)
    We'll need some other attribute to describe the idea of context; Or perhaps deduce
    context from the body.
