    Though I'm not sure if I totally care. I have many things to read and I don't see the purpose of fully understanding
    this if I don't have further troubles with scorch.

* TODO Have a plan for describing, indexing, and recalling words with multiple meanings
  - Note taken on [2018-10-14 Sun 07:42] \\
    As an example, the word 'terminal' has different meanings based on its context.
    If the context is "shell scripting", then terminal means that thing you're
    typing into. 
    
    If the context is "Backusâ€“Naur Form" then 'terminal' means "tokens",
    "smallest block in our BNF grammar".

    It is clear in this case, we don't want to treat terms and defintions simply as
    terminal (title) => thing you're typing into (body)
    We'll need some other attribute to describe the idea of context; Or perhaps deduce
    context from the body.
